<p class="home_text">Grand Theft Auto was the first game in the Grand Theft Auto series of games which was originally released for MS-DOS and Windows-based PCs back in October 1997. In the game, players take control of a criminal who travels freely through the three main cities of the Grand Theft Auto series that have been the subject and settings of subsequent games. These include Liberty City, Vice City, and San Andreas. The missions of Grand Theft Auto are all crime based missions which will have the player take part in criminal activities such as grand theft auto, bank robbery, assault, theft, and more. Players learn of new missions by answering public telephones where crime bosses will detail specific tasks or "jobs" that need to be performed.</p>
<p class="home_text">The original Grand Theft Auto, and Grand Theft Auto 2 features two-dimensional graphics with the camera looking down on the action from a bird's eye view of the streets from a few stories above. Like other titles in the series, the game offers freedom to complete missions at the player's leisure, however, the original Grand Theft Auto is somewhat limited and not full sandbox/open style freedom seen in later titles. The primary objective for players is to reach a certain number of points in order to complete a level and move onto the next one. Points are earned by accepting missions from Buddey Seragliano's gang and completing them, the points are also used as money to purchase various items but this takes away from your score and goal for completing levels. Missions also become increasingly difficult as the game progresses, in which case the Grand Theft Auto 1 Cheats and Codes will come in handy for those who are stuck.
Grand Theft Auto 1, as it is most commonly referred to now, was released as registered freeware by Rockstar Games in 2004. At the time of this writing, the Rockstar Classics free download series is unavailable, but the game can still be downloaded from various 3rd party sites as detailed in the Grand Theft Auto free PC game page.</p>

<h1><em>Grand Theft Auto 2</em></h1>
<img src="images/gta gta2/GTA_2-_Box_Front.jpg" alt="gta2 box" height="376px" width="300px">
<p class="home_text">Grand Theft Auto 2 is the second main title in the Grand Theft Auto series of games but the fourth overall title when the GTA London expansion and mission packs are included. The game, like its predecessors Grand Theft Auto 1 and GTA London, is an open world action-adventure game and played from a top-down perspective giving players a bird's eye view of the building and streets of the city. Unlike the original Grand Theft Auto and the games that followed, Grand Theft Auto 2 is set in a no-name city called Anywhere City, USA and the game is set sometime in the near future from the time of its original release. The Anywhere City is divided into three districts or sectors each of which contains three organized crime gangs that can hire players to perform missions. There are a total of seven organized crime gangs, one of which is present in all three districts and then two of the remaining six gangs are found in each district.</p>
<p class="home_text">Missions in Grand Theft Auto 2 use the same format used in Grand Theft Auto, players will receive phone calls on public pay phones from crime bosses who want them to perform certain jobs. Grand Theft Auto 2 expands upon a number of gameplay aspects of the original, one is the aspect of multiple crime gangs. Players have the ability to perform missions for different gangs which can cause a certain level of distrust from the competing gangs of the sector a mission may take place in. Another new feature to GTA 2 is the types of law enforcement that can pursue the main character. The original game only had local police, but in addition to local police GTA also features SWAT teams, special agents, and even the army. These more advanced types of law enforcement begin to pursue players as they attain higher levels and proceed to through the three districts of the city. Grand Theft Auto 2 also features four multiplayer game modes, Deathmatch, Race, Tag and Team Deathmatch.</p>
<p class="home_text">The PC version of Grand Theft Auto 2 allows for single player gameplay to be played in two different modes simply know as noon or dusk. Noon was set during daytime and used lower graphics settings while dusk was set during the early evening where more advanced graphics were required to account for various light sources and shadows. In addition to the PC, the game was also released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation consoles and the Game Boy Color handheld system. The game was released as registered freeware from Rockstar Games but like Grand Theft Auto 1, it is currently not offered for download from Rockstar. Third party sites however still do host the game and make it available for free download.</p>
