<p class="home_text">Grand Theft Auto III is a third-person action-adventure game released in October 2001 and is the first game in the series to feature gameplay in the third-person, over the shoulder viewpoint. It is also the fifth title in the series and follow-up to Grand Theft Auto 2 but does not follow the storyline setup in <a class="nav_link" href="gtagta2.html">GTA 2</a>. The game enhances upon the open world nature of the game's story allowing players to traverse the city and complete missions at their leisure in a non-linear fashion. Missions can be categorized as either story-based missions or side missions with players being able to complete them in virtually any order. GTA 3 also marks the return to Liberty City, one of the three main cities of the Grand Theft Auto world that was first introduced in Grand Theft Auto 1. Players take on the role of Claude, a criminal who is shot by his girlfriend during a bank robbery and subsequently arrested by police, convicted, and sentenced to jail. However, upon transfer to jail Claude and another prisoner escape and make their way to a safe house where he is introduced to a crime boss and thus begins his quest for vengeance.</p>
<p class="home_text">In addition to introducing the main character with a story rich background, Grand Theft Auto 3 was also the first game in the series built using a 3D game engine and it quickly became the best-selling video game for 2001 and was praised by fans and critics alike despite some backlash surrounding the game's violent gameplay and story. The gameplay of combining a third-person shooter and driving simulation in an open world found in Grand Theft Auto III was not a new concept but it did popularize this gameplay which has been used in all the GTA games since as well as many other non-GTA games. Much like the previous titles, as the player advances levels by completing missions and committing crimes his "wanted" level will increase which triggers different levels of law enforcement who start to pursue them.</p>
<p class="home_text">Grand Theft Auto III is still popular today and is available from most PC game digital download services, there is also a full list of cheats, codes, and walkthroughs available, those having difficulty getting past a certain mission are encouraged to try them out. GTA 3 contains only a single player mode and was originally released for Microsoft Windows-based PCs, Xbox and PlayStation consoles, it has since been released for Mac OS, Android, and iOS platforms.</p>

<p class="home_text">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, like most games in the series, was critically acclaimed and the number one selling game of 2004. but not without controversy. The controversy surrounding GTA: San Andreas was considerably greater than previous titles due to sexually explicit content that was unlockable through a fan made a mod called the Hot Coffee Mod. The existence of this content caused a huge uproar from special interest groups and government officials alike and caused the Entertainment Ratings Safety Board to change the rating of GTA: San Andreas from Mature to AO for Adults Only. This subsequently led to major retailers suspending sales of the game and pulling it from store shelves. Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive responded quickly, by releasing a "Cold Coffee" patch that disabled this content. The content was then removed from the game's source code and re-released after the M rating was re-instated. Without this content Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas still contains a number of cheats and secret content that can be unlocked.</p>
