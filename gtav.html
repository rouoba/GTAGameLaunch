As with previous titles, players will unlock different parts of the game world as the progress through the story based missions but will have the ability to take on side missions and jobs which can be completed at their leisure. The story revoles around the three protagonists and criminals, Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton, who engage in criminal activity under threat from rival government agencies.
